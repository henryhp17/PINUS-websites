				<h3>Lantip</h3><hr class="belowtitle">
				<p>Lantip’s journey starts upon leaving his mother and the village of Wanagalih as he is adopted into the <i>priyayi</i> family of Sastrodarsono. Under the strict and sometimes iron-fisted guidance of Noegroho, Sastrodarsono’s son, Lantip has to do what he must and work his way to earn his right to the prestigious <i>priyayi</i> title while repressing his own feelings and passion. Unable to restrain his exuberant fascination with the arts, he continues to secretly dedicate his time to writing scripts and plays, and in so doing he defies Noegroho’s stern prohibition from pursuing his own interests. It is this burning passion of his, coupled with the turn of events that unfolds around him, that motivates him to eventually espouse a whole new notion of life and join the cultural group <i>Singa Arjuna</i>.</p>

				<h3>Gadis</h3><hr class="belowtitle">
				<p>Gadis is an intelligent, driven and hardworking girl who is both Lantip’s rival and close friend in Eyang Kusumo’s <i>wayang</i> troupe. After Lantip leaves Wanagalih, she was left to her own path and as she observes the living condition in the village, she becomes more and more determined to be of a helping hand to the people of Wanagalih. Years later, her path comes across Lantip’s once again as she joins the cultural art society <i>Singa Arjuna</i> in the city of Wanalawas. Their heartfelt passion for the performing arts brings the two childhood friends closer, and as they embark on their own journeys to achieve their ideals, their friendship starts to grow and develop into something more.</p>

				<h3>Noegroho</h3><hr class="belowtitle">
				<p>Noegroho was raised as a <i>priyayi</i> under the stern guidance of his father, Sastrodarsono. This led to a distant relationship between the two and a fixation on his part to maintain the <i>priyayi</i> title he has worked so hard to earn. When his father wishes to adopt Lantip into his family, he is not happy with the idea, and this stance of his shows through his strict and uncompromising manner towards the new boy in the family. After Sastrodarsono’s passing, he inherits the lands in the village of Wanagalih and has to deal with the difficulties in managing both his lands and his finances. As time goes by, he increasingly becomes too preoccupied by his efforts to uphold the status and image of his <i>priyayi</i> family to the point where he neglects to remember what it really means to be a <i>priyayi</i>.</p>

				<h3>Marie</h3><hr class="belowtitle">
				<p>Her mother’s death has left Marie alone only with her father who does not seem to truly care for her. As she grows up, Marie finally finds what she believes to be love upon seeing Lantip - a talented and gentlemanly schoolmate of hers who eventually becomes her fiance through the plan of an arranged marriage agreed by her father and his business partner. She appears to be a self-centered girl who demands a lot and believes that she deserves nothing and nobody but the best, but in truth, she really is a lonely girl yearning for a taste of love she has never had.</p>

				<h3>Ngadiyem</h3><hr class="belowtitle">
				<p>Ngadiyem is a kind-hearted lady with an overflowing love for her only son, Lantip. Known for her delectable homemade <i>tempeh</i> and admired for her selfless nature, she has grown close to Sastrodarsono, one of her most loyal customers, through events in the past. Letting her son go to be adopted by Sastrodarsono’s family is the hardest choice she has ever had to make, but she knows that this will bring Lantip a brighter future and a more comfortable life than she can ever offer. After all, she believes that from the start Lantip has always deserved a better life than that in the village.</p>

				<h3>Martokebo</h3><hr class="belowtitle">
				<p>For as long as he can remember, Marto has always seen life as a zero-sum game of wealth and power. As a result, he spends most of his time taking care of his businesses and managing his trades, leading to a growingly decayed relationship with his own daughter Marie, for whom he has little time for, if any at all. Always trying to quantify anything and everything, he could never comprehend other people’s feeling, and consequently the only way he shows his affection towards his daughter is through gifts and money. As he becomes more and more obsessed with his desire for money and might, he begins using every possible means to obtain the upper hand, even at the expense of those around him.</p>

				<h3>Eyang Kusumo</h3><hr class="belowtitle">
				<p>His love for <i>wayang</i> and the performing arts is channelled to the <i>wayang</i> troupe that he leads in the village of Wanagalih. Also a respected storyteller, he is held in high regard by people in the village in spite of - or perhaps because of - his quirky demeanour. The young stars of his troupe, Gadis and Lantip, particularly admire him as a mentor. Eyang Kusumo is an idiosyncratic but wise and knowledgeable old man, and he sees art as a means to bring joy and comfort to the audience - a perception on the arts which unfortunately leads to a disagreement of ideas between him and his own student, Lantip, later on.</p>
