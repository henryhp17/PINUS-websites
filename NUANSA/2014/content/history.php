				<p>Our most recent production, NUANSA'13: Dance of the Earth - One Woman, Two Dreams, Three Loves, originally written by Oka Rusmini, revolved around the life and struggles of Balinese women. Being born as a Sudra - a person of the lowest echelon in the caste system - Luh Sekar strove to 'marry up' for the sake of achieving nobility. After painstaking efforts and endless prayers, her dream came true. Being the prima donna dancer of her village, Sekar caught a Brahman man's attention which granted her way to climb to the highest caste, Brahman. Just when her dream to marry a Brahman came true, she found out that her marriage was nothing like what she dreamt of as she was caught in her husband's search for ephemeral pleasure and undue lust. NUANSA'13 revolved around the themes of happiness, true love, freedom, and sacrifice.</p>
				<p>Supported by the elaborate traditional Balinese dances and costumes, as well as original music, NUANSA'13 once again became our milestone as we reached a whole new level in our production quality. Held in UCC hall, NUANSA'13 attracted 1100 audience from various backgrounds - an increase of 20% from the previous show. NUANSA'13 was once again featured by Metro TV as well as The Student Globe of Beritasatu Media Holdings, one of the leading media companies in Indonesia.</p>

				<p>NUANSA’12: Canting – A Dying Family, A Dyeing Tradition was based on a novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It recounted the story of the Ngabehi Sestrokesuma family, which owned a family batik factory with hundreds workers. Despite the struggles faced by the family, the story ultimately reveals how modern and conservative values can co-exist and complement each other. Canting highlighted Indonesia’s traditional batik-making and Javanese dances, music, and culture.</p>
				<p>The artistic quality of NUANSA’12 has increased even further, as for the first time, we held the production in an even larger scale at the highly coveted UCC Hall, NUS. The setup included elaborate costume, lighting, music, and dance and successfully attracted a full house of around 900 audiences. </p>
				<p>This musical performance also gained a widespread coverage, notably by Metro TV, a national Indonesian television news channel, in the “8-11” show on Sunday, 28th October, 2012. It was also featured in Lian He Zao Bao, the flagship Chinese daily in Singapore. We were also honored to have the original author of Canting, Arswendo Atmowiloto, gracing our enchanting performance.</p>

				<p>NUANSA’11: Ca Bau Kan – The Musical was adapted from Remy Sylado’s renowned novel of the same title. It recounted the love story between a ca-bau-kan, a term referring to a woman entertaining rich Chinese businessmen, named Tinung and a successful Chinese businessman, Tan Peng Liang, which was set during the Japanese Occupation in Indonesia.</p>
				<p>In this fourth production, we continued to evolve as the production began to incorporate more elements of a musical into the show. The hard work of the artistic team gave birth to NUANSA’11: Ca Bau Kan - The Musical, which seamlessly weaves various traditional dances and songs into the newly introduced format of a musical cultural production.</p>
				<p>This full house production was performed in the Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC Faith Centre for Performing Arts, attracting around 850 audiences in total for both the matinee and night shows.</p>
				<p>Another breakthough was also made in 2011 as the success of NUANSA as a cultural production group finally managed to reach the ears of the people in Indonesia for the first time, as the show was covered in The Jakarta Post, a regional newspaper, in its 20 November 2011 edition.</p>

				<p>Our third installment, NUANSA’10: This Earth of Mankind, was an adaptation of the first book of the epic literary tetralogy: the Buru, by the famous Indonesian novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer. It told the tale of Minke, a descendant of Javanese royalty and his struggles against the unjust life during the Dutch colonisation period.</p>
				<p>Staged in UCC Theatre, NUS, NUANSA’10 was a significant milestone in our young history, as the team managed to push the bar for the production quality to a whole new level.</p>
				<p>Additionally, NUANSA’10: This Earth of Mankind was also our first production where the audience were charged for the show. The revenue stream from the sales of around 700 tickets gave the team more financial flexibility to obtain costumes and build sets and properties to improve the artistic quality of the cultural production, and helped ensure the sustainability of the production in the future.</p>

				<p>Looking at the resounding success of the first-ever show in 2008, NUANSA was continued in 2009.</p>
				<p>NUANSA'09: Sitti Nurbaya - Unfulfilled Love, was based on Marah Roesli's famous Indonesian novel with the same title. This time, the culture of the Minangkabau, from West Sumatra, was chosen as our production's main cultural theme. The story itself revolved around the love story of two teenagers, Samsul Bahri and Sitti Nurbaya in the early 20th century, when forced-marriage was commonplace in Indonesia.</p>
				<p>Only our second production, NUANSA'09 became the first of our production that was fully staged in English, affirming our vision to reach out to the Singapore community as a whole.
