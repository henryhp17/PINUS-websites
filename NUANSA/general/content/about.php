				<p><span class="history-title">NUANSA'08: Prambanan - A Thousand Beauties,</span> was adapted from the famous Indonesian folklore from 9th century about the origin of Candi Prambanan, a Hindu Temple in Central Java, Indonesia. It followed an intricate tale of a man's attempt to win a princess' love, intertwined with deceit and rejection.</p>
				<p>This maiden production was staged at the University Cultural Centre Theatre, NUS, with more than 400 audience. The show was free of charge (under the support of Exxon Mobil Campus Concerts) and performed in Bahasa Indonesia with the infusion of various authentic traditional dances and musical instruments from Indonesia.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="history09c" class="history-content">
				<p><span class="history-title">NUANSA’09: Sitti Nurbaya - Unfulfilled Love,</span> was based on Marah Roesli’s famous Indonesian novel with the same title. This time, the culture of the Minangkabau, West Sumatra, was chosen as our production’s main cultural theme. The story itself revolved around the love story of two teenagers, Samsul Bahri and Sitti Nurbaya in the early 20th century, when forced-marriage was commonplace in Indonesia.</p>
				<p>Only our second production, NUANSA’09 became the first of our productions that was fully staged in English, affirming our vision to reach out to the Singapore community as a whole. Like the previous NUANSA, this performance was also staged free of charge in the University Cultural Centre (UCC) Theatre, NUS, which again successfully attracted more than 400 audience.</p>

			<div id="history10c" class="history-content">
				<p><span class="history-title">NUANSA’10: This Earth of Mankind,</span> was an adaptation of the first book of the epic literary tetralogy: The Buru, by the famous Indonesian novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer. It told the tale of Minke, a descendant of Javanese royalty and his struggles against the unjust life during the Dutch colonisation period. Staged in UCC Theatre, NUS, NUANSA’10 was a significant milestone in our young history, as the team managed to push the bar for the production quality to a whole new level.</p>
				<p>Staged in UCC Theatre, NUS, NUANSA’10 was a significant milestone in our young history, as the team managed to push the bar for the production quality to a whole new level. Additionally, NUANSA’10 was also our first production where the audience were charged for the show. The revenue stream from the sales of around 700 tickets gave the team more financial flexibility to obtain costumes and build sets and properties to improve the artistic quality of the cultural production, and helped ensure the sustainability of the production in the future. </p>

			<div id="history11c" class="history-content">
				<p><span class="history-title">NUANSA’11: Ca Bau Kan - The Musical</span> was adapted from Remy Sylado’s renowned novel of the same title. It recounted the love story between a ca-bau-kan, a term referring to a woman entertaining rich Chinese businessmen, named Tinung and a successful Chinese businessman, Tan Peng Liang, which was set during the Japanese occupation in Indonesia. In this fourth production, we continued to evolve as the production began to incorporate more elements of a musical into the show. The hard work of the artistic team gave birth to NUANSA’11, which seamlessly weaves various traditional dances and songs into the newly introduced format of a musical cultural production.</p>
				<p>This full house production was performed in the Anglo-Chinese Junior college (ACJC) Faith Centre for Performing Arts, attracting around 850 audiences in total for both the matinee and evening shows. The success of NUANSA in 2011 finally managed to reach the ears of the people in Indonesia for the first time as the show was featured in The Jakarta Post, a leading regional newspaper, in its 20 November 2011 edition.</p>

				<p><span class="history-title">NUANSA’12: Canting - A Dying Family,</span> A Dyeing Tradition was based on a novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It recounted the story of the Ngabehi Sestrokesuma family, which owned a family batik factory with hundreds of workers. Despite the struggles faced by the family, the story ultimately reveals how modern and conservative values can co-exist and complement each other. Canting highlighted Indonesia’s traditional batik-making and Javanese dances, music and culture.</p>
 				<p>The artistic quality of NUANSA’12 has increased even further. The production was held in the highly coveted UCC Hall, NUS, attracting a full house of 900 audience. The play was also supported by a more elaborate costume, lighting, music and dance.</p>
 				<p>This musical performance also gained a widespread coverage, notably by Metro TV, a leading national Indonesian television news channel, in the Eight Eleven Show (“8-11”) on Sunday, 28th October 2012. It was also featured in Lian He Zao Bao, the flagship Chinese daily in Singapore. We were also honoured to have the original author of Canting, Arswendo Atmowiloto, gracing our performance.</p>

				<p><span class="history-title">NUANSA’13: Dance of the Earth</span> originally written by Oka Rusmini, revolved around the life and struggles of Balinese women. Being born as a Sudra – a person of the lowest echelon in the caste system – Luh Sekar strove to “marry up” for the sake of achieving nobility. After painstaking efforts and endless prayers, her dream came true. Being the prima donna dancer of her village, Sekar caught a Brahman man’s attention which granted her way to climb to the highest caste, Brahman. Just when her dream to marry a Brahman came true, she found out that her marriage was nothing like what she dreamt of as she was caught in her husband’s search for ephemeral pleasure and undue lust. NUANSA’13 revolved around the themes of happiness, true love, freedom, and sacrifice.</p>
				<p>Supported by the elaborate traditional Balinese dances and costumes, as well as the original music, NUANSA’13 once again became our milestone as we reached a whole new level in our production quality. Held in UCC hall, NUANSA’13 attracted 1100 audience from various backgrounds – an increase of 20% from the previous show. NUANSA’13 was once again featured by Metro TV as well as The Student Globe of Beritasatu Media Holdings, one of the leading media companies in Indonesia.</p>

				<p><span class="history-title">NUANSA’14: The Priyayi,</span> tells the story of Lantip, a boy who grew up in a humble background. He then had to bid farewell to his dear mother and village when he was adopted as a grandson into the priyayi family of Sastrodarsono, who himself came from a humble peasant background before working his way up to earn the prestigious title of “Priyayi”. Years later, Lantip had grown up to be a caring and righteous man, proudly espousing his priyayi values. His life took an interesting turn when, upon entering university, he met his childhood sweetheart, Gadis, who was a member of a Youth Cultural Movement. After a series of unfortunate events, including his mother’s death, Lantip discovered that not every priyayi lived up to his priyayi ideals.</p> 
				<p>Inspired by the novel “Para Priyayi” by Umar Kayam, NUANSA ’14 presented a musical full of mesmerising dance choreography as well as captivating original music. The Priyayi had brought the beauty of the Javanese culture as we explored how the Sastrodarsono family strove to navigate through the complexities of priyayi.</p>
