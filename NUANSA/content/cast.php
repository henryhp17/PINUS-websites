			<div id="tewerautc" class="cast-left"><h3 class="cast-title">Teweraut</h3><br>
			<p>Teweraut is an Asmat word for orchid. She is the older of the twins, and is also a strong-hearted young girl who has longed to venture beyond her village and bring the marvels and modernity of the outside world to Ewer. Nevertheless, she quickly learns the difficulty of gaining the support of even those dearest to her. When tensions heighten and the repercussions of her decisions become uncontrollable, she must choose whether to continue fighting for her dreams or risk losing all she has worked for.</p></div>
			<div id="anggrekc" class="cast-right"><h3 class="cast-title">Anggrek</h3><br>
			<p>Anggrek is an Indonesian word for orchid. She is the younger of the twins and is also a typical Asmat woman who is reserved and obedient. She finds contentment in managing the household and dreams to be a wife and a mother someday.  Nevertheless, Anggrek soon discovers that life does not always go the way she wants, even if she follows all the rules. At the end of the day, Anggrek has to make a choice between protecting her loved ones, and protecting her beliefs.</p></div>
			<div id="akatpitsc" class="cast-right"><h3 class="cast-title">Akatpits</h3><br>
			<p>With a compelling charisma, a formidable reputation and a good chance of marrying the village head's daughters, the highly esteemed Akapits seems to have everything under his belt to succeed as Ewer's new chief. But when the village is confronted by divisions, the pressure mounts for Akatpits to reconcile the extremes and restore peace. Will he allow his battles bring out the demons within him or will he rightfully stand up against the forces and exert his power to do the noble thing once and for all?</p></div>
			<div id="hendroc" class="cast-left"><h3 class="cast-title">Hendro</h3><br>
			<p>As a businessman from Jakarta, it is natural for Hendrobudiyanto to seek profits from any venture he happens to dabble with. His coming to Ewer seems like a worthy investment since he believes that the village has plenty of potential for growth . His progressive mind set wins him the admirations of the youngsters, particularly Benwar, who hails him as a role model in seeking success. However, is there more behind Hendro’s generosity to the villagers of Ewer?</p></div>
			<div id="benwarc" class="cast-right"><h3 class="cast-title">Benwar</h3><br>
			<p>Benwar’s parents die of an unknown disease when he is ten, and to him, the fault lies with his village’s obsession in living a secluded existence. He grows relentless each day, vowing to keep on fighting until he can break free from the kind of life they are living in. This opportunity surfaces in Teweraut’s decision to build a school in Ewer. Nevertheless, the rather sluggish progression their village is making, spurs him to seek another way to quench his thirst for a modern life.</p></div>
