				<h4 class="content-title">Synopsis</h4>
				<p>Teweraut and Anggrek are twin sisters, born in a rural Asmat village of Ewer. Both of them live a peaceful and unsuspecting life under the care of their nDiwi (father) who is also Ewer’s village chief. Their lives take an unexpected turn when their nDiwi breathes his last. Anggrek believes that continuing her traditional life would bring her happiness and so, decides to marry the newly elected village chief, Akatpits. Teweraut, on the other hand, pursues education in Jakarta so that she can return to Ewer as a teacher. The two inevitably have to part ways.</p>
				<p>Five years later, Teweraut returns to the village and the sisters are once again reunited. Nevertheless, her return as a teacher prompts changes in the village, and they are never easy to accept. While Teweraut feels the need to embrace progress for the sake of their village, Anggrek fears that radical changes will threaten the very fabric of their traditional life. As opposition from either side becomes more and more apparent, strong private interests thrives within the shadow of discord. Will Teweraut, Anggrek and the Asmat people be able to reconcile their traditional way of life with modern developments? Or will a tragedy occur before they realise what is truly important?</p>
				<p>The musical is adapted from Ani Sekarningsih’s most celebrated work “Namaku Teweraut.” It explores the inescapeable changes that befell the Asmat society coupled with our very own original songs and dances. “Flowers of Asmat” brings us the exotic culture of the Asmat society and seeks to question the relevance of our identity in the midst of an increasingly homogeneous world.</p>
