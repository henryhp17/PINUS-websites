Before NUANSA was conceived in 2007, PINUS worked with ExxonMobil and performance groups from NTU and SMU in showcasing Indonesian culture in a PINUS Production: When I Was in Indonesia. Directed by Tony Sugiarta, this production offered a wide range of performances involving angklung, gamelan, as well as Tari Piring and Tari Sekar Jagat.">
