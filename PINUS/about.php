		<hr size="1" color="#A1A1A1" width="100%" align="center">
		<p><b>PINUS</b> is a group of Indonesian Students in National University of Singapore (NUS) established in 2006. Starting as a humble group of Indonesians created to facilitate simple gatherings, PINUS has now grown into one of the most established Indonesian student groups in Singapore. Currently, we have more than five hundred members, and the number is still growing steadily every year.</p>
		<p>As a group that facilitates Indonesians in NUS, we aspire to provide avenues for our members to express their unique opinion, talent and creativity. In PINUS, we believe in a learning and nurturing culture, and hence we also strive to serve as a place for our members to grow and gain various experience as an individual.</p>
		<p>PINUS organises a wide array of activities for its members, ranging from culture to social work to sports. Our notable events include our very own cultural production, <a href="./event.php#nuansa">NUANSA</a>; a community involvement project for villages in Indonesia, <a href="./event.php#mkp">Misi Kami Peduli (MKP)</A>; a sports championship for charity, <a href="./event.php#hoa">Hari Olahraga Amal (HOA)</a>. In addition, we also organise <a href="./event.php#ori">PINUS orientation</a> every year to welcome all incoming Indonesian freshmen to our family.</p>
		<p>PINUS is affiliated to <a href="http://ppisingapura.org/">Indonesian Students&#39 Association in Singapore (PPIS)</a>.</p></div>

		<hr size="1" color="#A1A1A1" width="100%" align="center">
		<p><b>PINUS</b> started as a non-formal group for Indonesian students in NUS under a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pinus/" target="_blank">Yahoo! mailing list</a> which was founded on August 12, 1998. It was first utilised for the members to promote casual gatherings ("Together Day") over lunch, movies, friendly basketball matches - or even just to broadcast member achievements and the subsequent &#39thanks&#39 that follow: a channel of mass communication in those pre-Facebook days.</p>
		<p>It was formalised as an organisation and constitutionalized with vision and mission in 2006, with the pioneer executive committee formed for office term 2006/2007. Nevertheless, even before then, PINUS has already had some form of organisation within the group, with the existing position of a Head as well as committee members.</p>
		<p>Since its early days, PINUS has been encouraging all kinds of activities for its members to cultivate and showcase their talents, in line with its mission:

		<td valign="top"><p>In the <b>Arts and Cultural</b> scene, PINUS has contributed to the rich diversity within the NUS campus by participating in cultural nights, showcasing Indonesian traditional dances, music as well as cuisine within its grounds. PINUS' very first PINUS Production took place in 2007 and has grown bigger than ever today in the form of musical productions, NUANSA, still aiming to promote our unique Indonesian culture to the NUS community and the public at large.</p></td>

		<p>PINUS has grown together with the size of Indonesian student population in NUS over the years. Currently it has over 500 members from the undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in NUS from all faculties. Until now, PINUS&#39 role to unite and strengthen the bonds between fellow Indonesian students within and beyond the organisation has continued to stand out and become more prominent.</p>
		<ul class="image"><img src="img/about/translogo.png" width="600px"></ul>
		<p>With the introduction of the new PINUS logo in 2013, we aim to reestablish our image as a more active and vibrant community. The refreshed visual identity will provide us renewed energy and spirit to continue our efforts in nurturing the growth of the Indonesian community in NUS.</p></div>
