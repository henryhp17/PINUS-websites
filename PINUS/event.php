		<ul class="image"><img src="img/event/orientation.jpg" width="600px"></ul>
		<p>PINUS Orientation is a one-week event aiming to fulfil the dual objectives of alleviating the difficulties Indonesian freshmen may experience as they undergo their transition to the new environment in NUS, as well as strengthen bonds between both new and existing PINUSians.</p>
		<p>Orientation participants will be divided into several Orientation Groups (OGs), comprising of 12-14 people led by 2 Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs). OGs will play and compete with each other in a series of fun and engaging activities that are prepared especially for them.</p>
		<p>Beside presenting participants with an opportunity to let their hair down and break the ice, PINUS orientation also aims to enlighten freshmen pertaining to important aspects of NUS life. This will be achieved by holding orientation events in important places located both inside and outside NUS that should be taken note of, while incorporating education about NUS and the facilitation of interaction between orientation participants into the programs.</p>
		<ul class="image"><img src="img/event/kulinite.jpg" width="600px"></ul>
		<p>PINUS Orientation will culminate with KuliNite (Malam kumpul-kumpul Indonesia di NUS), a semi-formal finale night in which participants will have the chance to showcase their talents through group performances and pageants.</p>
		<p>PINUS Orientation is hoped to lay the foundations for a solid relationship among PINUSians and kick off the new academic year with a blast.</p>

		<ul class="image"><img src="img/event/nusantaraku.png" width="400px"></ul>
		<p>Nusantaraku is an annual event held to celebrate the independence day of our beloved nation, Indonesia. Usually set at the weekend of the independence day week, the event is held on two consecutive days, where different fun activities are organised to commemorate the festivities. The activities range from sports games such as futsal, basketball and captain's ball to traditional games such as balap karung and tarik tambang.</p>
		<p>In addition, the night of the second day will be the "Finale Night", where we invite all Indonesians in NUS to gather and immerse in the spirit of tujuhbelasan. The highlight of the night would be the performance by the members of the incoming batch of freshmen, who combines their efforts together to put up a special show for the audience. We hope that the gathering will allow everyone to relive the atmosphere of independence day even when we are away from our home country.</p></div>

		<p><b>NUANSA</b> is an annual arts and cultural event that started in 2008. Before NUANSA was conceived in 2007, PINUS worked with ExxonMobil and performance groups from NTU and SMU in showcasing Indonesian culture in a PINUS Production: When I Was in Indonesia. Directed by Tony Sugiarta, this production offered a wide range of performances involving angklung, gamelan, as well as Tari Piring and Tari Sekar Jagat.</p>
		<p>The name NUANSA - NUS and Indonesia was first suggested by Tito Husein Batubara. The first ever NUANSA, a 2008 musical drama, was directed by Elis Tjandra, titled Prambanan - A Thousand Beauties. A full list of past NUANSA performances include the following:</p>

		<hr size="1" color="#A1A1A1" width="100%" align="center">
		<ul class="image"><img src="img/event/mkp.png" width="600px"></ul>
		<p>Misi Kami Peduli (MKP) started as a channel to connect PINUS and orphanages in Indonesia, a simple donation drive that aimed to make a difference to the lives of those less privileged. It focused on raising fund through selling snacks at sports events or collecting old clothes and newspapers. MKP emphasizes volunteerism to lend a helping hand to our fellow countrymen who are in need, both back at home and also those working in Singapore.</p>
		<p>Its first project in 2002 involved donating to two orphanages in Jakarta, Yayasan Aulia and Yayasan Murakabi. It has since then grown into a larger scale community project, accompanied by the annual Hari Olahraga Amal, where PINUSians are involved directly in teaching local students as well as the renovation or upgrading of the facilities and infrastructure in villages and the more rural areas in Indonesia - the latest MKP 2012 gave birth to a brand new fresh water pipe to a relatively remote village in Lombok island in West Nusa Tenggara province.</p>
		<p>We are proud to have successfully organized this project consistently year after year, and the next one is surely not to be missed by the big-hearted PINUSians. Do contact our social division for more information at <a href="mailto:social@pinusonline.com"><i>social@pinusonline.com</i></a>.</p></div>
