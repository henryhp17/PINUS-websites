		<ol id="guide">
		<li><div class="entry-title">Getting to NUS<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p><i><b>By Cab: </b></i>Confused about what to say to the cab driver? No worries, just remember these lines:
		<ol type="A">
			<li><u><i>Prince George Park's Residence(PGPR)</i></u>: Tell the cab driver to "Go to NUH direction via South Buona Vista Road". When you see the NUH building, you will see a PGPR residence sign near the traffic light on your left. Then, tell him to follow the directions and stop at PGP foyer (you will see a big entrance to PGPR with "Prince George Park Residence" emblazoned there).</li>
			<li><u><i>University Town (Tembusu, Cinnamon, College of Alice and Peter Tan)</i></u>: The driver should know UTown, just tell him to go via Dover Road and stop in front of NUS UTown bus stop.</li>
			<li><u><i>Residence Halls(Eusoff, Raffles, Temasek, Kent Ridge, King Edward VII, and Sheares)</i></u>: Just tell him to go to NUS Kent Ridge campus. Once there, use the NUS campus map to find your destination hall. Don't worry, it should be easy to use the map, and you can always ask somebody in the campus; they are more than willing to help :)</li>
		</ol></p>
		<p><b><i>By MRT: </i></b>Alight at Kent Ridge Terminal(CC24, yellow line). You may also want to purchase an Ez-link card since you will be boarding MRTs quite often. If you go to B1 Street Level, you can take A1/A2 bus from the busstop in front of NUH.</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Check In? No Problem!!<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>You are able to check-in to your accommodation 24 hours and this applies to MOST hostels (except UTown residence) you are posted into, so don't worry about adjusting the time of your flight (to be sure, please check with respective Management Office).</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Senior Pick-up<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>Still confused about checking-in and all those hassles about getting to NUS? We, seniors, will come to the rescue! We are offering the Senior Pick-Up service in which we will escort you from Changi airport to your hostel and also help you settle the process of checking-in.</p>
		<p> So, interested? Just go to PINUS Orientation registration form and indicate your interest on the form. Hope to see you there!</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Medical Check-up<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p><b><i>Period: 22 June - 6 August 2015</i></b></p>
		<p>We strongly encourage you to conduct your medical examination in NUS to avoid any unwanted complications and incompatibilities that can arise if you complete the test in Indonesia. It will cost $50 (fifty Singapore dollars) for you to get the test done here.</p>
		<p>Please do not delay in taking this test, therefore, we recommend you to take it after QET on 15th July afternoon and 16th July morning.</p>
		<p>Check this <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/healthservice/PreME%20-%20August.html" target="_blank">link</a> for further info and to book your appointment.</p>
		<p>Early booking is essential to get the date you want!<br>The medical examintation will be at the University Health Centre (UHC), NUS (it’s not in NUH :)) To get there, you can take the NUS internal shuttle bus. For bus lines A1/D2, alight at the “Opposite Staff Club” busstop while for bus lines A2/D1, alight at the “Staff Club” busstop.</p>
		<p>Several things to take note:
		<ol>
			<li>Bring your documents as specified in the correlating section of the documents checklist (pg 23)</li>
			<li>Wear a plain t-shirt or blouse (but if you don’t have one, it’s okay, usually they’ll ask you to wear their disposable X-ray gown anyway)</li>
			<li>For girls, please do the medical examination at least 5 to 7 days after the end of your menses, since there will be a urine test. However, if that’s not possible they usually allow you to take the urine test some other time.</li>
			<li>One week after your check up, don’t forget to bring your passport and go back to UHC to collect your results :)</li>
		</ol></p>
		<p>Please refer to the information available <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/healthservice/pre-admission-exam/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Thirdly, you can also apply for the Tertiary Student EZ-link card. For more information, you can get it <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/images/ssc/download/ezlinkssc2013.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. But if you are not going to use the public transport outside NUS frequently, the normal EZ-link card will do.</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Student Pass Application and Collection<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p><b><i>Please refer to the previous section about the Student Pass Application Information for schedule.</i></b></p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">MOE Tuition Grant<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><h3>Online Application</h3>
		<p>You have to indicate in the online form that you wish to apply for the Tuition Grant, you will have to submit an application via <a href="https://tgonline.moe.gov.sg/tgis/normal/index.action" target="_blank">MOE’s website</a> from 19 to 25 August 2015.</p>
		<p>An email from the Office of Financial Aid will also be sent to your NUS email account in August with more information on the application of the grant and the signing of its agreement.</p>
		<p>For more information on the MOE Tuition Grant, please visit <a href="https://tgonline.moe.gov.sg/docs/TG-FAQ.pdf" target="_blank">MOE’s website</a>.</p>
		<h3>Signing of Agreement</h3>
		<p>Next is the signing of the agreement. You should be informed of the dates via NUS Mail also.</p>
		<p>You will need your two sureties to sign the Tuition Grant Agreement with you on your signing date. However, if they cannot be present in Singapore for the signing, you can have them sign in Indonesia under the presence of a notary public. Just give them the soft copy of the agreement (after you finished the application) on the website, have them sign it then send it back to Singapore.</p>
		<p>The instructions for filling the agreement can be found <a href="https://tgonline.moe.gov.sg/docs/NPbooklet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. You then only need to bring the signed documents to the signing location, and DONE! Make sure to read and agree to the terms and conditions too.</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Bank Accounts<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>A Singapore bank account is a must-have for NUS students. Other than simplifying daily payments and savings, this bank account can be used as a channel for paying tuition fees and receiving financial aid or scholarship funds. </p>
		<p>Due to its ubiquity in and around NUS, the OCBC is recommended. Nearest OCBC are at Holland Village and Clementi. You can refer to <a href="http://gothere.sg" target="_blank">gothere.sg</a> to find out how to make your way there. You will need to have your passport and NUS offer letter on hand when you open your bank account.</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Centralised Online Undergraduates Registration System(CORS)<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>CORS is the module allocation system in NUS. Each semester, students will be allocated points that will then be used to bid for modules of their choice through CORS.</p>
		<p>Generally, students will be bidding for elective modules, or modules outside of their major. However, there will be some instances of students bidding for their core modules, which are within the scope of their major.</p>
		<p>There are separate rounds of bidding for different types of modules with varying Modular Credits(MCs) limits. Knowledge about CORS can only be procured through experience, so we are not going to discuss it in detail here. However, you can always refer to the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/cors/" target="_blank">CORS official website</a> or ask around.</p>
		<p>The bidding exercise will commence in week 0, where you will be able to enter the system and understand it better. By then, we hope that you will have been able to enter and explore the system or pose questions to your seniors, hence gaining an extent of familiarity.</p>
		<p>In any case, you are always welcome to raise the question about bidding in PINUS Freshmen 2015 Facebook Group. We will also provide a session on CORS Bidding during PINUS Orientation 2015.</p>

		<ol id="guide">
		<li><div class="entry-title">PINUS Orientation Week<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>PINUS will help you to settle down in NUS and facilitate your transition from College to University. Therefore, join us for PINUS Orientation Week from 23rd – 26th July.</p>
		<p>PINUS Orientation is an annual event. During these four days of a roller coaster ride, we invite you, freshmen, to embark on your NUS journey with us. Meet your fellow Indonesians, be they other freshmen, graduating seniors, or even NUS alumni. Enjoy the fun exploring NUS and Singapore, and gain valuable insights on the perks of being a PINUSian. Embrace your inner soul and your culture!</p>
		<p>Have a wonderful journey with us! Register at <a href="http://pinusonline.com/pinusori2015reg" target="_blank">pinusonline.com/pinusori2015reg</a>! :)</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Hall and Faculty Orientations<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>Now that PINUS Orientation is over, don’t go rushing back home! Join your faculty or hall orientations! Meet new friends from all nationalities and have fun with them! Learn about their culture and widen your network!</p>
		<p>You can seek further information about a myriad of other orientation events by posting in the PINUS Freshies Facebook group or simply directly asking the seniors you know. They can also advise you on the advantages of attending these orientation events. For instance, in halls, the orientation week is generally considered a very important event for making friends, while for the Engineering Faculty, Engine O-week may not hold the same level of significance.</p>
		<p>The end of the NUS orientation period is customarily marked with the Rag and Flag extravaganza. Flag Day, usually held on Tuesday of week 0, is when NUS students from all faculties and halls join together in an island-wide donation campaign. Rag Day, on the other hand, is the day when the NUS community gets to thank all the donators for the money they’ve donated.</p>
		<p>There will be open to public performances from all the faculties and halls, usually attended by the Singapore President. Members of the halls and faculties would have spent their three months summer holiday constructing a float for their 15 minutes performance on Rag Day.</p>
		</div></li>
		</ol></div>
		<div id="knowcont"><h2>Things to Know</h2>
		<ol id="guide">
		<li><div class="entry-title">Purchasing Laptops, Electronics, Gadgets<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>The Matric Fair is usually a great place to snag some great bargains for laptops. Great promotions which bundle hardware and software will be available there, mostly for Microsoft Office and Adobe Products. These bundles will also come with the Operating System CD (Windows 8, Windows 7, or Mac OS Lion).</p>
		<p>If you want to buy gadgets and other electronic goods, the Funan Digital LifeMall is a good place to go. Although Sim Lim Square has more choices than Funan, the prices there can be quite high if you are not adroit at haggling with the vendor. Even so, it is still not advisable to make purchases at SimLim Square as some of the vendors are not official vendors and therefore do not provide warranties on their items. This is not the case at the Funan Digital LifeMall. Moreover, the prices there are not that high; the same as the prices on the vendor's official website. </p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Kedutaan Besar Republik Indonesia (KBRI)<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>The Indonesian Embassy, also known as Kedutaan Besar Republik Indonesia (KBRI), is located at 7 Chatsworth Road.</p>
		<p>To get there from NUS, you can go to Holland Village by the Circle Line MRT and take bus 75. Alight at "Before Grange Road" bus terminal, from which the embassy is within walking distance. For alternative routes of more detailed information on getting to the Indonesian Embassy, you can refer to <a href="http://gothere.sg" target="_blank">gothere.sg</a>.</p>
		<p>The embassy is the place where you can renew your passport when it is expired. You don't really need to bring your photo with you as they have a photo booth inside, but it is recommended to do so if you have your photo as the photobooth is quite crowded. The KBRI conducts ceremony every year on 17th of August. For the Muslims the KBRI is also hosting Idul Fitri and Idul Adha prayer every year and also Taraweh and break fast on Ramadhan.</p>
		<p>For more information, you can visit the embassy website <a href="http://www.kemlu.go.id/singapore/Pages/ContactUs.aspx?l=lc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Indonesian Restaurant and Foods<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>Craving for a taste of Indonesian food? Fear not! You can always patronize restaurants in Singapore serving Indonesian food; to name a few, there are J-town cafe, Ayam Penyet Ria, and Minang House. Ayam Penyet Ria and Minang House are located at the Lucky Plaza, serving Ayam Penyet and Padang cuisine respectively. J-town cafe, on the other hand, is located around Orchard Road and serve an assortment of Indonesian dishes like Bakmie, Siomay, and Batagor. The price for the food itself is quite high compared to the NUS canteen but it is worth the nostalgic moment of home.</p>
		<p>General Indonesian items like seasoning, sambal, Indomie etc, can be found in Belanja.com and ShengSiong. Belanja.com is located around Orchard and offers a pretty large catalogue of Indonesian items. The nearest ShengSiong store from NUS is located at west coast and Clementi. It sells items like Indomie and Kecap.</p>
		</div></li>
		<li><div class="entry-title">Recreation Around NUS<br></div>
		<div class="entry-content"><p>Bored after grueling hours of study sessions? Want to get out and unwind for a while? Wanna catch the latest movie in the theatre? No problem! There are three big malls near NUS.</p>
		<p>Vivo City, the biggest of them all, is only a 20 minute bus ride away. Catch a movie, shop for presents, or just lounge on  the rooftop garden to enjoy the sunset. Clementi Town Centre, comprising of the newly built Clementi Mall and the smaller, older cityVibe, is only 15 minutes from NUS whereas the smallest, but not the least important mall, is West Coast Plaza. You can get your fix of Sakae Sushi there. West Coast Plaza is the nearest from NUS, only 10 minutes away.</p>
		<p>If you are lazy to go out of NUS but need to restock on snacks and tidbits, don't worry. Nanyang Supermarket, located in PGPR, and Fairprice Express, located in U-Town, is the answer. They might not be as complete as supermarkets outside NUS, but they provide a lot of your daily needs: milk, fruits, bread, even soap and shampoo. There are also 24-hour convenience stores (two Cheers and a 7-Eleven) if you need something late at night.</p>
